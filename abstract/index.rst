Abstract
========

Rust does not provide function overloading exactly as we are used to in languages such as Java or
C++. We shall start by going into some detail on what overloading is, how it is used and how you
might work around its absence in languages that do not have it. This will help us reason about which
of Rust's features may be of help in achieving results similar to those allowed by straight function
overloading in, say, C++, but in a more "Rusty" way. The idea is to discuss language fundamentals
together rather than to present esotheric techniques.


Biography
=========

I started out professionally with C, moved on to C++, added a little Python and had to settle for
Java. Never a pure programmer, throuhout my career I dealt with system administration, version
control, software architecture, team leading. For a long time C++ was my favourite language, even
though I've come to appreciate how convenient Python is for getting things done. A few years ago I
finally gave up on C++ out of frustration for its ever increasing complexity. I discovered Rust
around the same time and loved immediately the way it appeared to provide elegant solutions for many
of C++ problem areas.
